# Lem-in path-algorithm

Helsinki Hive (42 school) project;

In collaboration with Otto Koponen;

Personal project time: ~280 hours in a span of 70 days;

Subject:  
Lem-in pathfinding algorithm, 
Moving ants through a maze (a file with 1 to 1000 vertices with 1 to 40000 edges is passed to the program);

Restrictions: 

- Allowed functions: write, malloc, free and exit;  
- All sudden unsuspected terminations and/or leaks result to failing grade;  
- All code must be written according to the school 42 norm (see section norm in main page);  
- Within reasonable time (1 second for 100% grade, 13 seconds to pass);
- Turn accuracy has be in reasonable scope from optimal (absolute accuracy for 100% grade, 20 diff to pass);

Problems:
- Finding all possible combinations of path sets;
- Implementing path grading system to find best set;

Learned concepts: 

- Hashtable;
- Queue;
- Min/Max flow(Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp);
- Dynamic memory allocation;
- More accurate errorhandling;
